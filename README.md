LAMP Stack // "Enough" Web Development and Security Project -- HTML/CSS/JScript/PHP/mySQL

This repository contains all files related to a LAMP Stack created in Phase 3/5 in my Flatiron School Cyber Security Engineering Bootcamp.
It includes all files needed to host the website entitled "Enough" which is a queer self-defense workshop that exists currently in NYC. At the time of the creation of this project Enough did not yet have a website, so I utilized this assignment as an opportunity to design a rough draft of what an Enough website could look like. 

This collection of code represents my first deep dive into ALL coding languages present. It represents about 3 full 9-hour days of exploration and experimentation with each lanugage. There are many things I would do differently / add to make this a more complete and functional website but in the context of the scope of this assignment, I was able to wrap my head around the basics of several languages, and then subsequently understand the security implications, both inherent and self-generated, that are present within this basic web stack --- which there are many. 

For the assignment this code was hosted on a CentOS VM which ran HTTPD, Apache, and MariaDB.
